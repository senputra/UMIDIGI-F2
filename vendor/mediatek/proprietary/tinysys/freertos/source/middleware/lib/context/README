NOTICE:
This library contains the Activity(Context) feature that can detect user activity (still/walk/run/bike/
vehicle/on stairs/tilt) in real-time.
The library, liblecontext.a, is built and can be linked already.
For people who may like to use these APIs, just includes context.h and see the definitions in header file.
