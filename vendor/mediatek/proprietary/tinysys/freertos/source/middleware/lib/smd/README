NOTICE:
This library contains the significant motion detection feature that can detect user's significant motion, like walking for 10 steps, in real-time.
An event will be triggered when a user walks over 10 steps and makes a significant position change.
The library, lismd.a, is built and can be linked already.
For people who may like to use these APIs, just inludes smd.h and see the definitions in header file.
